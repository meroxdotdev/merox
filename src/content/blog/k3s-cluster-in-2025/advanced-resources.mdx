This guide covers additional tools and resources to enhance your K3s cluster, including NFS storage integration, monitoring solutions, GitOps with ArgoCD, and maintenance procedures.

## Using NFS Storage

If you want to use NFS storage in your cluster, follow this guide: [Merox Docs - NFS Storage Guide](https://docs.merox.dev/operations/containerization/k3s/manifests/nfs-share/?h=nfs)

## Monitoring Your Cluster

A great monitoring tool for your cluster is [Netdata](https://docs.merox.dev/operations/containerization/k3s/manifests/netdata/).

You can also try deploying Prometheus and Grafana from Rancher. However, if you don't fine-tune the setup, you might notice a high resource usage due to the large number of queries processed by Prometheus.

## Continuous Deployment with ArgoCD

ArgoCD is an excellent tool for continuous deployment. You can find more details [here](https://docs.merox.dev/operations/containerization/k3s/manifests/argocd).

## Upgrading Your Cluster

If you need to upgrade your cluster, I put some notes here: [How to Upgrade K3s](https://docs.merox.dev/operations/containerization/k3s/upgrade/).

## Final Thoughts

When I first deployed a K3s/RKE2 cluster (about a year ago), I struggled to find a single source of documentation that covered everything needed for at least a homelab, if not even for production use. Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything comprehensive, so I decided to write this article to consolidate all the necessary information in one place.

If this guide helped you and you'd like to see more information added, please leave a comment, and I will do my best to update this post.
