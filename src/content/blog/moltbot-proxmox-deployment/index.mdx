### 📢 Update: January 31, 2026

The project has rebranded again to **OpenClaw** (from Moltbot/Clawdbot) to emphasize its open-source nature and avoid further trademark issues. This is the final name—commands are now `openclaw` instead of `clawdbot`. Installer and docs links have been updated below. The core functionality remains the same, with added security hardening (34+ commits), new model support (e.g., KIMI K2.5, Xiaomi MiMo-V2-Flash), and channels like Twitch and Google Chat. Old names like Moltbot/Clawdbot are kept in searches for compatibility.

I've been watching the AI assistant space for a while now, and most solutions are either cloud-only, expensive, or just don't do enough. When I discovered **OpenClaw** (formerly Moltbot/Clawdbot), I was intrigued—here's an open-source AI assistant that actually performs actions, not just answers questions. It clears your inbox, manages your calendar, sends emails, and integrates with WhatsApp, Telegram, and Slack. Best of all? You can self-host it.

After deploying it on my Proxmox homelab, I wanted to share what makes OpenClaw worth the setup effort and how to get it running efficiently.

**Here's what I'll cover:**
- What OpenClaw is and why it's different
- Key features that make it worth self-hosting
- Deploying on Proxmox using the official installer
- Basic Proxmox setup considerations
- Real-world use cases and limitations

### ⚠️ Important: Critical Security Alert (Jan 2026)

As of January 31, 2026, **Clawdbot/Moltbot has officially rebranded to OpenClaw** following trademark disputes. If you see "Clawdbot" or "Moltbot" in older docs/commands, it refers to the same project—update to `openclaw` for the latest.

**Security Risks You Must Know:**
* **Exposed Credentials:** [Bitdefender has reported](https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/moltbot-security-alert-exposed-clawdbot-control-panels-risk-credential-leaks-and-account-takeovers) that hundreds of misconfigured instances are leaking API keys, OAuth tokens, and chat histories. **Do not expose your dashboard to the public internet.** Use VPN/tunnels like Tailscale for remote access.
* **Prompt Injection:** Attackers can potentially exfiltrate your emails by sending a malicious message that triggers the AI agent. Recent updates include 34+ security commits to harden this.
* **Shell Access:** Running an AI with local shell access is "spicy." Always deploy in a strictly isolated Proxmox LXC/VM. Consider unprivileged LXC for extra security.

## What Makes OpenClaw Different?

Most AI assistants are glorified chatbots. They answer questions, maybe help with writing, but they don't actually *do* things. OpenClaw is different—it's designed to be an **AI agent** that performs actions across your digital life.

### Core Capabilities

- **Email Management**: Clears inboxes, sends emails, organizes messages
- **Calendar Automation**: Manages your schedule, books meetings, sends reminders
- **Task Management**: Creates and tracks tasks across platforms
- **Multi-Platform Integration**: Works through WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, or any chat app (new: Twitch, Google Chat)
- **Workflow Engine**: Features "Lobster," a workflow system for composable automations
- **Persistent Memory**: Remembers context and preferences across conversations

## Why Deploy on Proxmox?

Proxmox is perfect for this because:

- **Isolation**: Run OpenClaw in a dedicated VM or LXC container
- **Resource Management**: Easy to allocate CPU, RAM, and storage
- **Backup Integration**: Leverage Proxmox Backup Server for automated backups
- **Network Control**: Configure firewall rules and network isolation
- **Snapshots**: Test configurations without breaking production

I'm running OpenClaw in an **Ubuntu 22.04 LXC container** with 4GB RAM and 2 CPU cores, which handles my personal use case perfectly. For heavier workloads or multiple users, you might want to allocate more resources (e.g., 8GB+ for Ollama models).

<AdSense />

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have:

- **Proxmox** installed and accessible
- **Basic networking** configured (static IP recommended)
- **An AI model provider** (OpenAI API, Anthropic Claude, or self-hosted Ollama; new support for KIMI K2.5 & Xiaomi MiMo-V2-Flash)
- **Node.js/Bun runtime** (OpenClaw runs on Bun or Node.js)

<Callout variant="note">
**Model Provider Options**: OpenClaw supports multiple AI providers. You can use OpenAI's API, Anthropic's Claude API, or connect to a self-hosted Ollama instance. For homelab setups, Ollama is the most cost-effective option since it runs entirely on your hardware.
</Callout>

## Setting Up the Container

Create an Ubuntu 22.04 LXC container in Proxmox with:
- **Disk**: 20GB
- **CPU**: 2 cores  
- **Memory**: 4096 MB
- **Network**: Static IP or DHCP

Start the container and SSH into it.

### Step 2: Install Bun Runtime

OpenClaw runs on Bun (a fast JavaScript runtime). Install it in your container:

```bash
# Update system
apt update && apt upgrade -y

# Install required dependencies
apt install -y curl unzip

# Install Bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Add Bun to PATH (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export BUN_INSTALL="$HOME/.bun"
export PATH="$BUN_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"

# Verify installation
bun --version
```

<Callout variant="tip">
**Alternative: Node.js**: If you prefer Node.js over Bun, you can install Node.js 20+ instead. However, Bun is recommended by the OpenClaw team for better performance.
</Callout>

## Installing OpenClaw

### Option 1: Using the Official Installer

The official installer is the recommended method. Run the installer script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.bot/install.sh | bash
```

This installer will:
- Install OpenClaw globally via npm (requires root/sudo)
- Set up the necessary configuration directories
- Make the `openclaw` command available system-wide

**For non-root installations**, use the CLI-only installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.bot/install-cli.sh | bash
```

After installation, the onboarding wizard starts automatically. If it doesn't, run:

```bash
openclaw onboard
```

<Callout variant="tip">
**Alternative Installation Methods**: OpenClaw also supports installation via Docker, Ansible, Nix, Bun, and cloud platforms (Railway, Render, Northflank). See the [official installation documentation](https://docs.openclaw.ai/install) for all available methods.
</Callout>

## Configuration

After installation, the onboarding wizard starts automatically. If it doesn't, run:

```bash
openclaw onboard
```

### Onboarding Process

The wizard guides you through:

1. **Security Warning**: Read and acknowledge the security notice
2. **Onboarding Mode**: Choose **QuickStart** (recommended)
3. **Model Provider**: 
   - **OpenAI**: Uses OAuth (browser opens automatically)
   - **Anthropic**: API key
   - **Ollama**: Self-hosted URL (e.g., `http://your-ollama-server:11434`)
4. **Channel Setup**: Choose your messaging platform:
   - **Telegram**: Get bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) (`/newbot`)
   - **WhatsApp**: QR code pairing
   - **Discord**: Bot token
   - **Slack**: Socket Mode token
5. **Skills**: Configure optional skills (skip for now)
6. **Hooks**: Enable automation hooks (optional)
7. **Agent Setup**: Configure your first agent in the TUI

### For Telegram (Easiest)

1. Open Telegram and message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Run `/newbot` and follow instructions
3. Copy the bot token (format: `123456:ABC...`)
4. Paste it when prompted in the wizard

### Starting OpenClaw

After onboarding, the Gateway service starts automatically. Access:

- **TUI**: `openclaw tui` (recommended)
- **Web UI**: `openclaw dashboard` (opens browser)
- **Check status**: `openclaw status`

Send a message to your Telegram bot (or other configured channel) to start chatting.

<Callout variant="tip">
**Configuration Location**: OpenClaw stores config in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`. Gateway logs are in `~/.openclaw/logs/gateway.log`.
</Callout>

## Proxmox Notes

- Ensure container has **outbound internet access** for API calls
- Set up **automated backups** via Proxmox Backup (backup `~/.openclaw/` directory)
- Monitor resource usage through Proxmox web UI

## What You Can Actually Do

Here are some real-world use cases I've been testing:

### Email Management
- "Clear my inbox of newsletters"
- "Send an email to [person] about [topic]"
- "What emails need my attention today?"

### Calendar Automation
- "Schedule a meeting with [person] next Tuesday at 2 PM"
- "What's on my calendar this week?"
- "Move my 3 PM meeting to tomorrow"

### Task Management
- "Create a task to review the quarterly report"
- "What tasks are due this week?"
- "Mark 'buy groceries' as complete"

### Multi-Platform Access
The beauty of OpenClaw is that you can interact with it through WhatsApp, Telegram, or Slack—whatever you already use. No need to learn a new interface.

## Troubleshooting

**Gateway won't start:**
```bash
# Check logs
cat ~/.openclaw/logs/gateway.log

# Check status
openclaw status

# Restart gateway
openclaw gateway restart
```

**Telegram bot not responding:**
- Verify bot token is correct
- Ensure bot is started in Telegram (message `/start` to your bot)
- Check Gateway is running: `openclaw status`

**OAuth issues (OpenAI):**
- Ensure browser can access `localhost:1455` for callback
- If callback fails, paste the redirect URL manually when prompted

**Container networking:**
- Verify outbound internet: `ping 8.8.8.8`
- Check Proxmox firewall allows outbound connections
- For Ollama: `curl http://your-ollama-server:11434/api/tags`

## Limitations and Considerations

OpenClaw is powerful, but it's not perfect:

- **API Costs**: If using OpenAI or Anthropic APIs, costs can add up with heavy usage
- **Learning Curve**: Setting up integrations requires some technical knowledge
- **Privacy**: Even self-hosted, you're still calling external APIs unless using Ollama
- **Reliability**: Self-hosted means you're responsible for uptime and troubleshooting
- **Platform Support**: Some integrations may require additional setup or have limitations
- **Resource Usage**: Ollama models require significant RAM (8GB+ for larger models)

<Callout variant="warning">
**Cost Awareness**: If you're using OpenAI's API, monitor your usage. A few hundred requests can quickly add up. Consider setting up usage alerts or using Ollama for cost-free local inference. Ollama is the best option for homelab setups—it's free and keeps everything local.
</Callout>

## Next Steps

Once you have OpenClaw running:

1. **Pair with Messaging Platforms**: Connect WhatsApp, Telegram, or Slack
2. **Configure Skills**: Explore the skill directory for extensions
3. **Set Up Workflows**: Use Lobster to create custom automation pipelines
4. **Monitor Usage**: Track API costs and resource usage
5. **Join the Community**: Check out the [OpenClaw GitHub](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) for updates and support

## Final Thoughts

OpenClaw isn't just another AI chatbot—it's a practical automation tool that actually does things. Deploying it on Proxmox gives you full control over your AI assistant while keeping costs predictable and data private.

The setup isn't trivial, but it's worth it if you want an AI assistant that integrates with your existing tools and workflows. For homelab enthusiasts, this is a perfect project to add to your infrastructure.
