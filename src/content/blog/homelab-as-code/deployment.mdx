This final guide covers the deployment process, post-deployment verification, and best practices for maintaining your homelab automation.

## Post Deployment

A successful deployment will show the following output in your console:

You can now access your Docker environment via Portainer using the IP (`IP_MACHINE`) and port `9000`. Example:  
```
http://172.20.0.252:9000
```

After setting up your Portainer user, you should see a dashboard like this:

**⚠️ Best Practice:** Regularly check your automation, at least monthly, to ensure everything is functioning correctly.

## Conclusion

Thank you for exploring this Homelab as Code project! By combining Packer, Terraform and Ansible, we've streamlined homelab automation and setup. I hope this guide inspires you to enhance your IT skills and optimize your infrastructure.

Happy homelabing, and don't hesitate to share your journey or questions—your feedback is always appreciated! 🚀

## Future Plans

In the coming weeks, I plan to expand this project by adding support for VM deployment using Cloud-Init and Packer. Additionally, I'm considering integrating advanced Ansible projects, such as K3S from TechnoTim, to enhance the automation and scalability of homelab environments.
