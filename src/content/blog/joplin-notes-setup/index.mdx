I wanted a note-taking solution I could actually own. Not rent from Apple, Google, or Microsoft—actually own. After years of bouncing between cloud services, I finally deployed Joplin Server in my homelab.

Here's the complete guide to self-hosting your own Joplin instance with Docker, complete with Traefik reverse proxy, PostgreSQL backend, and multi-platform client setup.

<Callout variant="note">
**What is Joplin?** An open-source, Markdown-first note-taking app that syncs across all platforms. Think Obsidian meets Evernote, but you control the infrastructure.
</Callout>

## Why Self-Host Your Notes?

Most note apps work great—until they don't. Services get discontinued, pricing changes, or you hit arbitrary sync limits. With self-hosted Joplin:

- **Complete data ownership** - Your notes, your infrastructure
- **No sync limits** - Limited only by your storage
- **True privacy** - Optional E2E encryption under your control
- **Cross-platform** - Same experience on iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux
- **Forever free** - No subscriptions, just infrastructure costs
- **Markdown native** - Plain text files you can read anywhere

<Callout variant="tip">
**Cost Reality Check:** Running this on Oracle Cloud's free tier Ampere instance costs exactly $0/month. Self-hosting doesn't have to be expensive.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before we start, you'll need:

- A server running Ubuntu (or any Linux with Docker)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- A domain with DNS configured (I'm using Cloudflare)
- Traefik already set up for reverse proxy (optional but recommended)

<Callout variant="warning">
**New to Docker?** This guide assumes basic Docker knowledge. If you're just getting started, check out the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) first.
</Callout>

## Docker Compose Configuration

I'm running Joplin Server alongside my other homelab services. Here's the complete docker-compose setup:

```yaml
services:
  # ... your other services ...

  joplin-db:
    image: postgres:15
    container_name: joplin-db
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your_secure_password_here  # Change this!
      POSTGRES_USER: joplin
      POSTGRES_DB: joplin
    volumes:
      - joplin_db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      network-cloud-merox:
        ipv4_address: 172.25.10.60

  joplin-server:
    image: joplin/server:latest
    container_name: joplin-server
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - joplin-db
    dns:
      - 1.1.1.1
      - 8.8.8.8
    environment:
      APP_PORT: 22300
      APP_BASE_URL: https://joplin.cloud.merox.dev  # Your domain here
      DB_CLIENT: pg
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your_secure_password_here  # Same as above
      POSTGRES_DATABASE: joplin
      POSTGRES_USER: joplin
      POSTGRES_PORT: 5432
      POSTGRES_HOST: joplin-db
    networks:
      network-cloud-merox:
        ipv4_address: 172.25.10.61
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.joplin.rule=Host(`joplin.cloud.merox.dev`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.joplin.entrypoints=https"
      - "traefik.http.routers.joplin.tls.certresolver=cloudflare"
      - "traefik.http.services.joplin.loadbalancer.server.port=22300"
      - "traefik.docker.network=network-cloud-merox"

volumes:
  joplin_db_data:

networks:
  network-cloud-merox:
    name: network-cloud-merox
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.25.0.0/16
          gateway: 172.25.0.1
```

<Callout variant="tip">
**Network Setup:** I'm using a custom bridge network with static IPs for better service discovery. Adjust the subnet and IPs to match your existing infrastructure.
</Callout>

### Key Configuration Points

**Database Choice:** I went with PostgreSQL instead of SQLite for better reliability and concurrent access. If you're running a single-user setup, SQLite works fine too.

**Environment Variables:**
- `APP_BASE_URL` - Your public HTTPS URL (critical for correct redirects)
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - Use a strong password, stored securely
- `APP_PORT` - Internal port (22300 is Joplin's default)

**Traefik Labels:**
- Automatic HTTPS via Cloudflare
- Host-based routing
- Load balancer pointing to internal port 22300

<AdSense />

## DNS Configuration

Since I'm using PiHole for local DNS resolution, I added the record there instead of only in Cloudflare:

### Option 1: PiHole Local DNS (if you run PiHole)

Edit `./etc-dnsmasq.d/04-custom.conf`:

```bash
address=/joplin.cloud.merox.dev/100.72.22.38
```

Then restart PiHole:
```bash
docker restart pihole
```

### Option 2: Cloudflare DNS Only

Add an A record in Cloudflare:
- **Type:** A
- **Name:** joplin.cloud (or just joplin if your subdomain is different)
- **Content:** Your server's public IP
- **Proxy:** DNS only (orange cloud off initially)

<Callout variant="note">
**Why both?** PiHole handles internal resolution via my Tailscale IP (100.72.22.38), while Cloudflare handles external access. You can use either method depending on your setup.
</Callout>

## Deployment

```bash
# Navigate to your docker-compose directory
cd /path/to/your/docker-compose

# Pull the images
docker-compose pull joplin-db joplin-server

# Start the services
docker-compose up -d joplin-db joplin-server

# Watch the logs
docker logs -f joplin-server
```

You should see output like:
```
Server started on port 22300
Database connection successful
```

## First Login and Setup

Navigate to `https://joplin.cloud.merox.dev` (or your domain).

**Default credentials:**
- Email: `admin@localhost`
- Password: `admin`

<Callout variant="warning">
**Security First:** Change the admin password immediately after first login! Go to Profile → Change Password.
</Callout>

**Screenshot placeholder:** `joplin-web-login.png` - Joplin Server web login screen

### Create a Sync User

Instead of using the admin account for syncing, create a dedicated user:

1. Click "Create account" on the login page
2. Use a real email (or fake one, since email isn't required for self-hosted)
3. Choose a strong password
4. Log in with your new account

**Screenshot placeholder:** `joplin-web-dashboard.png` - Joplin Server web dashboard after login showing user profile

This account is what you'll use in the mobile and desktop apps.

## Setting Up Desktop Clients

### macOS / Windows / Linux

1. Download Joplin desktop app from [joplinapp.org](https://joplinapp.org/)
2. Install and launch the app
3. Go to **Joplin → Preferences → Synchronization** (macOS) or **Tools → Options → Synchronization** (Windows/Linux)

**Screenshot placeholder:** `joplin-desktop-sync-settings.png` - Desktop app synchronization settings screen

4. Configure sync:
   - **Synchronization target:** Joplin Server
   - **Joplin Server URL:** `https://joplin.cloud.merox.dev`

<Callout variant="tip">
**Cross-Platform Magic:** Once all your devices are syncing, create a note on your phone and watch it appear on your laptop within seconds. It's pretty satisfying.
</Callout>

## Testing the Full Setup

Here's how to verify everything works across all platforms:

1. **Create a test note on desktop**
   - Title: "Test from Desktop"
   - Content: Add some text and maybe an attachment

**Screenshot placeholder:** `joplin-desktop-test-note.png` - Desktop app with a test note created

2. **Sync manually** (or wait for auto-sync)
   - Desktop: Click the sync button
   - Mobile: Pull down to refresh

3. **Check on iPhone**
   - Open Joplin
   - Pull down to sync
   - Verify the note appears

**Screenshot placeholder:** `joplin-ios-test-note.png` - iOS app showing the same test note from desktop

4. **Check on Android**
   - Open Joplin
   - Pull down to sync
   - Verify the note appears

**Screenshot placeholder:** `joplin-android-test-note.png` - Android app showing the same test note

5. **Edit on mobile, verify on desktop**
   - Edit the note on your phone
   - Sync
   - Check that changes appear on desktop

If all devices show the same content, your self-hosted sync is working perfectly!

## Homelab Benefits

Running Joplin on your own infrastructure gives you:

✅ **Complete control** - Your data never leaves your servers  
✅ **No limits** - Storage limited only by your disk space  
✅ **Privacy** - Optional E2E encryption you control  
✅ **Customization** - Modify server settings, backup strategies, etc.  
✅ **Learning** - Great project for Docker and self-hosting skills  
✅ **Cost** - $0/month on Oracle Cloud free tier, or whatever your VPS costs

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Sync Fails with "Connection Refused"

**Problem:** Mobile apps can't connect to server.

**Fix:** Check that your domain resolves correctly:
```bash
# Test DNS resolution
nslookup joplin.cloud.merox.dev

# Test HTTPS connectivity
curl -I https://joplin.cloud.merox.dev
```

If DNS fails, verify your PiHole/Cloudflare records. If HTTPS fails, check Traefik logs:
```bash
docker logs traefik
```

### "Invalid Email or Password"

**Problem:** Can't log in to server.

**Fix:** 
1. Verify you're using the sync user account (not admin@localhost)
2. Double-check the URL doesn't have trailing slashes
3. Ensure APP_BASE_URL in docker-compose matches exactly

### Slow Sync on Mobile

**Problem:** Sync takes forever on iOS/Android.

**Fix:**
- First sync is always slow (downloading all notes)
- Check network connectivity (WiFi vs cellular)
- Verify server isn't rate limiting (check `docker logs joplin-server`)
- Consider enabling E2E encryption for faster sync of large files

### Database Connection Errors

**Problem:** Server logs show "Cannot connect to database"

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
docker ps | grep joplin-db

# Check database logs
docker logs joplin-db

# Verify password matches in both containers
docker exec joplin-server env | grep POSTGRES
docker exec joplin-db env | grep POSTGRES
```

<Callout variant="tip">
**Pro Tip:** Enable auto-sync in mobile apps (Settings → Synchronisation → Synchronisation interval). Set to 5-10 minutes for near-real-time sync.
</Callout>

## Backup Strategy

Since you control the infrastructure, you control the backups. Here's my setup:

```bash
# Backup PostgreSQL database
docker exec joplin-db pg_dump -U joplin joplin > joplin-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Automate with cron
0 2 * * * docker exec joplin-db pg_dump -U joplin joplin > /backups/joplin-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).sql
```

**Screenshot placeholder:** `joplin-backup-script.png` - Terminal showing backup script running and creating dated backup files

For extra safety, I sync these backups to my NAS and occasionally to cloud storage. The beauty of self-hosting is you define your own redundancy.

<Callout variant="note">
**Database Backups:** If you're already running Longhorn in Kubernetes (like I am), you could also deploy Joplin there and leverage automatic PVC snapshots. But Docker Compose is simpler for this use case.
</Callout>

## Additional Features Worth Exploring

Once you have the basic setup running, check out these Joplin features:

### End-to-End Encryption

Enable in **Settings → Encryption**:
1. Click "Enable encryption"
2. Set a master password (don't lose this!)
3. Enable on all devices with the same password

**Screenshot placeholder:** `joplin-desktop-encryption.png` - Desktop app showing encryption settings enabled

Your notes are encrypted before syncing to the server, so even if someone gains server access, they can't read your notes without the master password.

### Web Clipper

Install the browser extension (Chrome/Firefox) to save web pages directly to Joplin:

**Screenshot placeholder:** `joplin-web-clipper.png` - Browser showing Joplin Web Clipper extension saving an article

Clips save as Markdown with formatting preserved. Great for research and documentation.

### Plugins

Desktop app supports plugins for extended functionality:
- Rich Markdown editor
- Kanban boards
- Templates
- Custom themes

Browse available plugins in **Tools → Options → Plugins**.

## Infrastructure Integration

Since I'm already running Traefik, Portainer, and PiHole, Joplin slots right into my existing stack. The docker-compose pattern is identical to my other services:

- Same network (`network-cloud-merox`)
- Same Traefik labels for HTTPS
- Same PiHole DNS resolution
- Same monitoring (Glances picks it up automatically)

**Screenshot placeholder:** `portainer-joplin-containers.png` - Portainer dashboard showing joplin-server and joplin-db containers running

If you're building a homelab, Joplin is a perfect addition to your self-hosted services alongside Nextcloud, Bitwarden, and whatever else you're running.

## Performance Notes

Running on Oracle Cloud Ampere (4 ARM cores, free tier):
- Initial sync of 500+ notes: ~3 minutes
- Incremental syncs: <5 seconds
- Web UI response: Instant
- Mobile app sync: 5-10 seconds
- Database size after 6 months: ~150MB

Resource usage is minimal:
```bash
docker stats joplin-server joplin-db
# joplin-server: ~50MB RAM, <1% CPU
# joplin-db: ~30MB RAM, <1% CPU
```

Perfectly suitable for low-power servers, Raspberry Pis, or spare hardware.

## Final Thoughts

Self-hosting Joplin has been surprisingly smooth. The Docker deployment is straightforward, the sync works reliably across all platforms, and having complete control over my notes infrastructure is worth the minimal maintenance overhead.

If you're already comfortable with Docker Compose and run other self-hosted services, adding Joplin is a no-brainer. It integrates seamlessly with existing reverse proxy setups and doesn't require Kubernetes or complex orchestration.

The multi-platform support is genuinely excellent—the same notes sync flawlessly between my iPhone, Android tablet, MacBook, and Linux desktop. No vendor lock-in, no sync limits, no subscription fees.

For homelab enthusiasts who want a robust note-taking solution without giving up control, Joplin Server is hard to beat.
