Let's dive into the configuration. Due to pfSense being based on FreeBSD and Tailscale not offering as much support for pfSense as for other platforms, this configuration is a bit trickier.

### Install Tailscale on pfSense

1. Navigate to **System > Package Manager** in the pfSense web interface
2. Click on the **Available Packages** tab
3. Search for `tailscale` and click **Install**
